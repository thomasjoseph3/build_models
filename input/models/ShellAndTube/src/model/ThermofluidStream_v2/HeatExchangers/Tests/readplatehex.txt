Modeling Plate Heat Exchangers (PHE) in ThermofluidStream_v2
===========================================================

1. Concept and Physics
----------------------
A standard single-pass Plate Heat Exchanger (PHE) operates with two fluids flowing 
in opposite directions across the plates. This arrangement maximizes the temperature 
difference between the fluids and is physically defined as "Counter-Flow".

Therefore, the `ThermofluidStream_v2.HeatExchangers.CounterFlowNTU` model is the 
correct mathematical representation for a PHE.

The Effectiveness-NTU relation used in `CounterFlowNTU.mo` is:
   effectiveness = (1 - exp(-NTU*(1 - C_r))) / (1 - C_r*exp(-NTU*(1 - C_r)))
   
This is the exact analytical solution for any counter-current heat exchanger, 
whether it is a plate, tube-in-tube, or other geometry.

2. How to Use
-------------
To model a Plate Heat Exchanger:
1. Instantiate `ThermofluidStream_v2.HeatExchangers.CounterFlowNTU`.
2. Set the `A` parameter to the total heat transfer area of the plate pack.
3. Set the `k_NTU` parameter to the overall heat transfer coefficient (U-value).

   Note: Plate heat exchangers have high U-values compared to shell-and-tube.
   Typical values for Water-Water PHE: 3000 - 7000 W/(m2*K).

3. When is a New Model Needed?
------------------------------
You do NOT need a new model for standard applications. 
You ONLY need to create a custom model (e.g. extending PartialNTU) if:

A. Multi-Pass Arrangement:
   If the PHE has a complex pass structure (e.g. 2-pass or 3-pass) where fluids 
   turn around and flow parallel in some sections, the standard Counter-Flow 
   equation is no longer 100% accurate. You would need a correction factor or 
   a specific Multi-Pass NTU correlation.

B. Variable Heat Transfer Coefficient:
   The `CounterFlowNTU` model assumes a constant U-value (`k_NTU`). 
   If high-fidelity simulation of partial loads is required, where U varies 
   significantly with mass flow (Re number), you should extend the model and 
   replace the `k_NTU` parameter with an equation (e.g. Wilson plot correlation).
