# FMU Project Standard Configuration
# This file defines the strict standard for all FMU projects.
# The build system relies on this structure to assemble the FMU dynamically.

project:
  name: "MyModel_Project"
  description: "Description of the physics model"
  client: "Client Name"
  version: "1.0.0"

# Metadata for FMU compilation
fmu:
  type: "cs"       # "cs" (Co-Simulation) or "me" (Model Exchange)
  version: "2.0"   # FMU version (usually 2.0)
  platform: "static" # "static" compiles binaries into the FMU
  output_name: "DigitalTwin" # The name of the resulting .fmu file

# Modelica Compiler Settings
modelica:
  # The fully qualified Modelica class name to simulate
  # Example: "MyPackage.MyModel" or "BiomassBoiler.DigitalTwin"
  model_class: "MyPackage.MyModel"
  
  # Modelica language version (e.g., 3.2.3, 4.0.0)
  language_version: "3.2.3"
  
  # Modelica Standard Library version to load
  # Default is "default" (usually 3.2.3), use "4.0.0" if needed
  msl_version: "default"

# Source File Locations
files:
  # The entry point file to load.
  # Scenario A: Single file -> "model/MyModel.mo"
  # Scenario B: Package -> "model/MyPackage/package.mo"
  # Note: Root path is input/src/
  # ALL MODELS MUST BE IN input/src/model/
  main: "model/MyModel.mo"
  
  # Optional: Extra source files to load (relative to input/src/)
  dependencies: []

# External Libraries (Dependencies)
# Place these libraries in input/src/libraries/
external_libraries: []
  # - name: "MyLib"
  #   path: "MyLib"  # Folder name inside src/libraries/

# Validation Settings
validation:
  # Tolerance for output comparison (±%)
  tolerance_percent: 5.0
  
  # Validation data must be named 'validation.csv' in input/test_data/

# Interface Definition
# Must match the Modelica model's inputs/outputs exactly.
